ARC-faceloss  
==
I changed the loss of the original lenet5 handwirtten Network:softmax loss.I use the Arc-loss replace of it.

I havenot finished my training,I only trained 220 steps as fllows,but tha acc on test data is very high 98.93%,which is higher than the 
original softmax loss 98.57% and the cos-loss 98.95%.It is very fast.
